A sorting algorithm that is built upon the principle of stalin sort

How so?

Here's how it works, you first do the stalin sort, eliminating all the unordered elements and send them to the gulag

The Gulag being a seperate pool of numbers that you can implement stalin sort into, do this until you reach the end of the array

Then you will have multiple pools of sorted sub arrays, meaning that you can implement merging
